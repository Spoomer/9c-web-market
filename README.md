# 9c-web-market
This project aims to deliver a web version of NineChronicles PC Market. The Server runs a node of the blockchain and crawles the blocks for new market transactions/offers. The first goal is the creation of a readonly web version.

## Desired Features
- market history (global + individual per address)
- current market offers (global + individual per address)
- filter options for offers and history


## Development Steps
0. Running a node with NineChronicles.Dataprovider or "barebone" with NineChronicles.Headless and crawling for market actions
1. Display market history globally
2. Display market history per address and other filters
3. Display current market offers globally
4. Display current market offers per address and other filters

## Futures Goals
After creating a readonly version, it would be nice to integrate chrono and add the possibility to create and accept offers.
